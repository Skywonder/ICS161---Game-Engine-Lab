Description:

Wormhole is a 3D platformer which requires the player to help the "Spaceship" reaching the end goal (the Wormhole). The player will be required to use some mechanical keyboard and puzzle solving skills in order to achieve the goal. The game is designed with an inspiration and admiration of the space environment (to recreate the grand scale of space feel). Every single assets in the game except the audios and some textures are all made one by one using Photoshop, Unity and Audodesk Maya. 
Simple scripts in combination with the Particle Systems are used to create some of the various animation effects in the game. 

Hope You Guys Enjoy It!!!
 

Jesper Juul's Rules:
1. Fixed Rules 
	a. Player will be forced to start over from (start/check points if falling too far off a platform)
	b. Player will have to use jump as the main challenging mechanic to go through the stage
	c. Black Hole has a hidden range that when the player approaches will apply additional gravity onto the player (Space environment has gravity?)
	d. Player can only go through the stages using the set key controls
	e. Player will be able to repeat the stage as many times as possible
	 f. Enter the Wormhole completes the Stage
	g. Each teleporter has a set destination

2. Variable, Quantifiable Outcomes
	a. Falling off the platform for certain distance
	b. Stay in the Gravity Zone
	c. Activating the mechanics 
	d. Reaching the Wormhole
	e. Controlled player
	 f. Use of Teleporter


3. Values associated with each Outcome
	a. Falling off the platform will result in start over at the closest check point
	b. Stay in the Gravity Zone will result in stronger gravity 	
	c.  Activating the mechanics will enable some platform movement
	d. Reaching the Wormhole will enable Player to travel to "End Game".
	e. Controlled player move base on inputs
	 f. Reappear on platform upon using teleporter

4. Challenges
	a. Player will have to jump through platforms w/wo obstacles (black holes)
	b. Player will have to solve some simple puzzles

	 
5. Player Attachments
	a. The Space Environment (Graphics)
